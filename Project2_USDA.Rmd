Few observations from the USDA dataset:<br><br>
1. Foods with more protein content are low in fat.<br>
2. Foods containing high protein have an higher average iron content.<br>
3. Foods with higher carbs have higher vitamin C levels.<br>
4. Surprisingly higher caloric foods do not seem to contain high sugar content.<br>
5. Fatty foods also seem to contain lesser sugar content.<br>
6. Fatty foods are in fact higher in calories.<br>

# Data Analysis
# The max value of Sodium seems suspicious as its too high. Lets analyse that.

USDA$Description[265]
# Table Salt - It makes sense that 100gms Table salt contains 38758 mg of sodium but no one would have this quantity of salt in one sitting.
# Hence, lets find out which foods contain say 10000 mg of sodium.

# Creating a dataframe as a subset of original one.
HighSodium <- subset(USDA, Sodium > 10000)
nrow(HighSodium)
HighSodium$Description

# The above list does not contain "CAVIAR" which is known to contain high sodium content. Lets look up "CAVIAR" in the dataset.
match("CAVIAR", USDA$Description)

# CAVIAR is 4154th observation. Find sodium content now.
USDA$Sodium[4154]

# OR this could be written in one step:
USDA$Sodium[match("CAVIAR", USDA$Description)]

# To understand the significance of this value, compare it to the mean and standard deviation of sodium.
summary(USDA$Sodium)
sd(USDA$Sodium, na.rm = TRUE)

# Observation: Mean + 1 SD ~ 1400mg of sodium which is < 1500 mg of sodium in CAVIAR. Hence CAVIAR is pretty high in sodium content given that most of the observations have a sodium content of 1400mg. So this value seems okay.
